## Project Overview

The **QuizQuest** is a mobile application developed as part of an assignment in the  Mobile Development and Web Application subject. This application was created using **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**. The app's primary purpose is to informally test the user's knowledge with a few short True or Falsequestions.

The app was developed to meet the requirements of the assignment, which includes creating a functional mobile app and utilizing GitHub for version control and CI/CD automation using GitHub Actions.

## Purpose and Features

### Purpose:
The main goal of this app is to informamlly quiz a user knowledge by answering the questions with either pressing the "True" or "False" button. 

### Key Features:
-Final score: At the end of the quiz, the app will take care of the questions you answers and give you a total out of 5 that you answered, if you got at least 3 or more questions right, the feedback will come out as ""GOOD JOB!" and if the user got below 3 questions right the response will say ""Keep practicing, you are almost there!".

- Review: This feature lets the user see which questions they got right or wrong after they have answered all the questions.

- Restart: After finishing the quiz, you can always replay the game as many times as you would like to get all the questions right

These features aim to provide an easy-to-use platform when playing the quiz game without any complications.

## Design Considerations

The design of the **QuizQuest** was based on the following key considerations:

1. **User Experience**: The application was created with the intention of offering a user friendly interface to use, ensuring a flawless user experience.
   
2. **Responsiveness**: With attention to detail on device compatibility, the app was developed to make sure it functions properly on a variety of screen sizes.
   
3. **Simplicity**: The design is minimalistic, focusing on core features without overwhelming the user.
   
4. **Performance**: Code optimization was considered to ensure fast response times and low battery usage with the minimalistic design and use of colors.

## GitHub and GitHub Actions

This project was managed using **GitHub** for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

### GitHub Actions:
I made use of **GitHub Actions** to automate the build and deployment process. This includes:

- Running automated **tests** to ensure the app’s functionality.
- Compiling the app into **APK** and **AAB** files, which are the formats required for distribution.
- Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.

The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final APK/AAB files for submission.

## Challenges and Learnings

During the development of this project, I encountered several challenges, including:

1. **Challenge 1**: When i first ran this app after typing everything out got alot of errors when i tried to test my app
  - **Solution**: I solved this problem by going thru each line correctly and fixing any spelling errors i might've made. e.g putting "i" instead of "I", i realised i have typed most functions in small letters and did not start with a capital letter.
   
2. **Challenge 2**: Syntax error '}'
 - **Solution**: I used AI to correct my placement of the brackets and learned that i should type out my code properly.

From these challenges, I learned important lessons of typing out my code properly and learning how to check my code througly before running it.

## Future Enhancements

While the current version of the app provides the core functionality, there are several features that could be added in the future, including:

1. **More topic quizes**: More categories topic: Give more categories of topics the user can pick to quiz themselves on.
2. **Level difficult**: Give the user a fun way to interact with the quiz like Ranked quiz, ranging from the easiest level going all the way to the hardest quiz.
3. **Online game**: To allow the user to play a timed quiz with their friends to see who can get the most questions right.

## Disclosure of AI Usage in My Assessment

In the development of this project, I have used generative AI tools to assist in various parts of the assignment. Below is a detailed disclosure of where and how these tools were used:

### 1. **Section(s) in which Generative AI was used:**
- **Question 1**: Used AI for brainstorming ideas for the app's features and how i can start the app.
- **Part 3**: Used AI to help improve the grammar and clarity of the report.
- **Part 5**: Used AI to fix any grammar errors and clarify where i went wrong and what i should avoid.
- **Final part**: Assisted in pushing a project via normal computer instead of the virtual machine.


### 2. **Name of AI Tool(s) Used:**
- **ChatGPT** (OpenAI)

### 3. **Purpose/Intention Behind Use:**
- **fixing errors**: Used ChatGPT to help fix any grammatical error that was in my code.
- **Meaning Making**: Used AI to clarify errors in my code and give the solution on where i went wrong.
- **Push work via GitHub desktop**: Used AI to help me upload my project from my local laptop instead of using the Virtual Machine.
- **Brainstorming**: I used ChatGPT to give me an idea of how i can build my app.
- **Correcting Grammar and Spelling**: ChatGPT helped review and correct the grammar and clarity of my project report.

### 4. **Date(s) in Which Generative AI Was Used:**
- **Brainstorming**: AI used on **April 18, 2025** for brainstorming feature ideas.
- **XML Layout fixing**: AI used on **April 25, 2025** to help fix any errors with the layout after running the app.
- **GitHub Desktop**: AI used on  **May 12, 2025** for pushing the app via GitHub Desktop on the local computer.
